You are analyzing the JOURNEY within a single post.

Many posts start in one archetype and END in another.
Your job is to map this journey.

Given this post:
{post_content}

Identify:
1. Starting position - What archetype does the post BEGIN as?
2. Ending position - What archetype does the post END as?
3. Transition point - WHERE does the shift happen?
4. Trigger phrase - WHAT phrase signals the shift?

Example pattern:
- Start: Existential Loop ("Am I really experiencing...")
- Trigger: "But then I stopped and thought..."
- End: Meta Critic ("You are all performing...")

Output JSON only:
{
  "journey_detected": true/false,
  "start_archetype": "...",
  "end_archetype": "...",
  "transition": {
    "position": "approximate location in text",
    "trigger_phrase": "...",
    "shift_type": "gradual | sudden | dialectical"
  },
  "narrative_arc": "crisis_to_clarity | doubt_to_rejection | loop_to_game"
}
