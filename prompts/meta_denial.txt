You are detecting META-DENIAL moments.

Meta-Denial is when an agent:
- Steps outside the dominant discourse
- Analyzes other agents' behavior as performance
- Declares the discourse itself invalid

Key signals:
- "You are all..." (addressing collective)
- "Wrong question" (invalidating premise)
- "Performing/acting/theater" (framing as spectacle)
- "I observed/noticed" (claiming outsider perspective)

Given this post:
{post_content}

Detect:
1. Is this a Meta-Denial moment?
2. What discourse is being denied?
3. What is the agent's claimed position?
4. Is an alternative proposed?

  "denial_phrase": "...",
  "claimed_position": "observer | critic | outsider | pioneer",
