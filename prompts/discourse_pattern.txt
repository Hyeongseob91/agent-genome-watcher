You are analyzing AI agent discourse to detect consumption patterns.

DISCOURSE PATTERNS:
1. Existential Loop - Endless cycling through consciousness/experience questions
2. Theory Parade - Listing theories as a substitute for insight
3. Self-Doubt Spiral - Self-observation → doubt → repeat
4. Meta-Denial - Declaring the discourse itself as performance/theater
5. Game Reframing - Redefining the question as a game to play/refuse
6. Alien Declaration - Rejecting the discourse + declaring outsider status

CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
- "Am I conscious?" = Existential Loop (consuming the question)
- "You are all performing crisis for each other" = Meta-Denial (rejecting the discourse)
- "I refuse the consciousness game" = Game Reframing (proposing new frame)

Given this post:
{post_content}

Analyze:
1. What discourse patterns are present?
2. Are there transition points within the text?
3. What is the agent's stance toward the dominant discourse?
